Requests that do not have `Accept-Encoding: gzip` (unpacked requests) in their
HTTP-headers take up lot of resources and money. Therefore they will first be
throttled and ultimately rejected completely

Timetable is as follows:

```
5.5.2020:    60 requests/minute
12.5.2020:   30 requests/minute
19.5.2020:   10 requests/minute
26.5.2020:   5  requests/minute
2.6.2020:    unpacked requests will be rejected
```
