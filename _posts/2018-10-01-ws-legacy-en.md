Websocket endpoints ws://tie.digitraffic.fi/api/v1/plain-websockets/tmsdata ja
ws://tie.digitraffic.fi/api/v1/plain-websockets/tmsdata/{lam-station-id} will be
ended 19.10.2018.

Old endpoints will be transferred to temporary addresses that will cease at the
end of the year. AmazonMQ will serve the new endpoints. More protocols will be
supported and subscriptions allows clients to receive data they are interested
in.

More info of these new endpoints will come soon.
