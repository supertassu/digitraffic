Digitraffic marine and road environment migrates to AWS-platform. Production
will migrate to AWS tomorrow 6th of November 2018. URL addresses and API do not
change.

Things to note:

- New environment will return all timestamps in Zulu timezone. It is up to the
  client to present the timestamps in preferred time zone.

- New database engine is Postgres. This may have some minor effect in result
  ordering.

Otherwise the environment should behave identically.

The migration was planned 30th of October, but it was postponed due to some
problems in data sources.

Websocket changes were annouced earlier in
