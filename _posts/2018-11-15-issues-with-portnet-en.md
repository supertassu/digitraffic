#### Portnet port visits affected

The data source for Portnet port visits has repeating availability failures.
Digitraffic is actively reaching out to resolve the issue, but so far we have
only had the source rebooted between failures.

#### We have no definite date for fix

Unfortunately the data source has not yet found the cause of the problem and
outages keep repeating. We will release more information when we have more
details available.

#### Why is this not showing on status.digitraffic.fi

Unfortunately we have no alert level set for the amount of port visits. The
value changes greatly from hour to hour and day to day. Current public
monitoring solution can not react to errors since it does not have access to
error logs.
