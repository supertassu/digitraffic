Digitraffic test environment migrates to AWS-platform today 29th of
October 2018. Production will migrate to AWS tomorrow 30th of October 2018.

Things to note:

- New environment will return all timestamps in Zulu timezone. It is up to the
  client to present the timestamps in preferred time zone.

- New database engine is Postgres. This may have some minor effect in result
  ordering.

Otherwise the environment should behave identically.
