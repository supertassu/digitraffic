The Digitraffic status page will be replaced with a new service on 26 March.

The new status page is already available at [https://status-test.digitraffic.fi](https://status-test.digitraffic.fi), which is also accessible via the "Status" link in the header at digitraffic.fi. For subscribing to status updates, there is an Atom feed available via the link at the bottom of the status page. Email subscription is also being planned.

The current status page will be available at [https://status.digitraffic.fi](https://status.digitraffic.fi) until approximately 10:00 EET on 26 March, after which it will be replaced by the new service. Please remember to update your Atom subscription to the new domain in case you had already subscribed.
