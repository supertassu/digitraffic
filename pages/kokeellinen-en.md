intro: Data from various experimental road projects
---

Experimental data sources offer data from various projects. The data is open for
everyone. Being experimental means that availability, contents and freshness of
data may vary.

If you are interested in data from expired sources please contact
digitraffic@fintraffic.fi.

Currently there are following experimental sources.

## Nordicway2-notifications (expired)

NordicWay 2 aims at enhancing traffic safety through Cooperative Intelligent
Transport Systems (C-ITS). The project is European Commission Connecting Europe
Facility-funded between 2017 and 2020, and it is implemented by the National
Road Authorities of Finland, Norway, Sweden and Denmark as well as private
companies and research centres.

In Finland, the Finnish Transport Agency is implementing the NordicWay2
project’s Finnish activities together with the Finnish Transport Safety Agency
Trafi. The project is also part of the Finnish Traffic Lab collaboration. The
Finnish deployment of the project comprises two activities: the C-ITS deployment
pilot and the Arctic Challenge study concerning road transport automation in
arctic snowy and icy conditions.

## Bridge vibrations (expired)

Aurora is a public test ecosystem created to ensure intelligent and automated
transport as well as solutions for road maintenance and asset management to meet
the requirements of all conditions. A part of Aurora ecosystem is an experiment
measuring the vibrations of bridges.

Data is unit-less acceleration values which correspond to measured voltage
values from the measurement devices. As such it is suitable for example to make
frequency analysis over time.

Each file contains 1 minute worth of data (32 kHz sample frequency, 4 bytes per
sample, little endian, binary). File name is in the pattern AL1501962095, where
A = Identifier of the measurement-card, L = Channel ( L or R ) and 1501962095 =
the file create time stamp (epoch, seconds).

Average file size is about 7 megabytes.
