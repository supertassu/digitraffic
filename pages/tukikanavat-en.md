On the [Digitraffic status page](https://status.digitraffic.fi/), users can subscribe via email or feed to notices regarding service disruptions and maintenance breaks. 
The status service also has an API for querying the state of components and fetching service notices. 
We will also be notifying about API sunsets via the status page.

Open developer communities form the support channel for the Digitraffic service. 
The communities operate on open Google discussion groups where all discussion is public. 
The specialists from Fintraffic and the service supplier for the Digitraffic service are involved in the communities. 
The discussion groups are also used to announce new API features.
