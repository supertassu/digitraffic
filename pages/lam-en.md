Fintraffic collects information about road traffic using automatic traffic measurement stations (LAM). Real-time and historical data are available.

# Operation of measurement points

TMS stations are composed of data collection units and induction loops embedded in roads. 
The stations contain sensors that produce computational data. 
The computations use sensor constants whose values are station-specific. The TMS device registers vehicles passing the point, 
recording data such as time, direction, lane, speed, vehicle length, time elapsed between vehicles and the vehicle class.
There are more than 450 stations in Finland.

# Real time data

Digitraffic service enables the utilization of real time data collected from TMS stations. 
The main documentation of the APIs' you can find at [Road traffic/Traffic measurement system (TMS)](/en/road-traffic/#traffic-measurement-system-tms).

Below you can find additional information about provided data.

## Computational sensors
The table below contains additional information about sensors.

* LIUKUVA = Measurements for the last n minutes
* KIINTEA = Measurements for a fixed window of n minutes

## Sensor constants
The table below contains values for sensor constants used by computational sensors. Note that the constant values vary by station, look them up here: [/api/tms/v1/stations/sensor-constants](https://tie.digitraffic.fi/api/tms/v1/stations/sensor-constants).

| Constant | Unit | Value range | Description
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| VVAPAAS1<br>VVAPAAS2 | km/h | 18-107 | Expected average free flow speed when traffic flows normally.
| MS1<br>MS2 | kpl/h | 200-3600<br>200-14000 | The maximum amount of vehicles per hour for a lane in an ascending/descending direction.
| Tien_suunta | Degree (°) | 0–360° | Road direction by degrees in an ascending/descending direction. North 0°, east 90°, etc.

# Historical data

In addition to providing real time data, the Digitraffic service enables the utilization of historical data collected from TMS stations.

## TMS reports

There are prebuilt reports based on the data available through a form.

[```https://tie.digitraffic.fi/ui/tms/history/```](https://tie.digitraffic.fi/ui/tms/history/){:target="_blank"}

- **Available data**: statistics of traffic volumes is available since 2010, average speeds since 2020 and raw data since December 2021.
- **Updating and reliability of traffic volumes**: yesterday’s data is updated each day usually between 8:00 and 9:00. If there are deviations in traffic volumes this subset of data is updated usually within a couple of days. Traffic volumes are inspected and corrected using advanced algorithms if needed.
- **Updating and reliability of average speeds**: yesterday’s data is updated each day usually between 8:00 and 9:00. Average speeds are calculated based on the actual detections from the device, which means the number of detected vehicles might deviate from traffic volumes in case the traffic volumes are corrected.
- **Updating and reliability of raw data**: yesterday’s data is updated each day usually between 8:00 and 9:00. The number of detected vehicles in raw data might deviate from traffic volumes in case the traffic volumes are corrected, or new raw data is updated after publishing of traffic volumes.
- **Data processing**: traffic volumes of each hour are inspected and corrected if needed. Faulty detections are removed from average speeds and raw data (Look The value of “faulty” is 1 if ...). The form returns data on a summarized level and allows users to choose their desired level of detail and filter data for example based on date, direction, lane and vehicle class.

## TMS raw data

Data collected from the stations is also available in raw form. The data is converted to a CSV format but not altered in any way.

### Accessing the data

TMS data is available in CSV files, one file for each TMS point for each day ("result file" below). A specific URL path is needed when accessing the data:

```https://tie.digitraffic.fi/api/tms/v1/history/raw/lamraw_[lam_id]_[yearshort]_[day_number].csv```

Where:

- lam_id = TMS point id
- yearshort = last two digits of the year
- day_number = ordinal date (1-366, taking into account leap years). 1.1. = 1

Example: to get data from TMS point number 101 for the date 1.2.2017, GET the URL:

[```https://tie.digitraffic.fi/api/tms/v1/history/raw/lamraw_101_17_32.csv```](https://tie.digitraffic.fi/api/tms/v1/history/raw/lamraw_101_17_32.csv){:target="_blank"}

### Description of the result file format

The result file is a CSV file separated by semicolons (;). The time is the current time in Finland: EET, or EEST during the summer. The CSV files contain the following fields (unit in parentheses):

- TMS point id
- year
- ordinal date
- hour
- minute
- second
- 1/100 second
- length (m)
- lane
- direction
- vehicle class
- speed (km/h)
- faulty (0=valid record, 1=faulty record)
- total time (technical)
- time interval (technical)
- queue start (technical)

The value of "faulty" is 1 if:

- year < 0 or year > 99
- day < 1 or day > 366
- hour < 0 or hour > 23
- minute < 0 or minute > 59
- second < 0 or second > 59
- "1/100 second" < 0 or "1/100 second" > 99
- speed < 2 or speed >= 199
- direction < 1 or direction > 2
- vehicle class < 1 or vehicle class > 7
- lane < 1
- length <= 1
- length > 39,8

The vehicle classes are:

1 HA-PA (car or delivery van)\
2 KAIP (truck, no trailer)\
3 Buses\
4 KAPP (semi-trailer truck)\
5 KATP (truck with trailer)\
6 HA + PK (car or delivery van with trailer)\
7 HA + AV (car or delivery van with trailer or camper)
