Digitraffic is a service operated by Fintraffic offering real time traffic
information. Currently the service covers information about road, rail and
marine traffic. The information is open data, which is distributed through open
APIs. As a term Digitraffic refers to digital traffic, a model representing
traffic.

The development of Digitraffic started in 2002 as a joint project between VTT
Technical Research Center of Finland and Helsinki University of Technology (now
Aalto University), with a goal to produce improved services for traffic
telematics. After the research phase Digitraffic was transferred to the Finnish
road aministration and later on, to the Center for Economic Development,
Transport and the Environment of Southeast Finland. The Finnish transport Agency
managed Digitraffic from 2014 to 2018, making Digitraffic fully open data,
deploying it in a cloud service and expanding it to cover information from rail
and marine traffic.

The information distributed through Digitraffic is based on data collected by
the Fintraffic, the Finnish Transport Infrastructure Agency and the Finnish
Transport and Communications Agency Traficom. The data is collected for
operative purposes and shares the data according to open data principles. Using
the data is free and does not require a contract with the Fintraffic. However,
the [licensing terms](https://vayla.fi/web/en/open-data/terms-of-use) must be
followed.
