### 4\. Purpose and legal basis for processing

Digitraffic is a distribution channel for open traffic data, through which
different transport operators can freely access traffic data produced by
Fintraffic, such as weather and condition data as well as disruption and
exceptional situation data.

Your personal data is processed to monitor the use of the Digitraffic service
and to investigate disruptions. The processing of your data is based on section
146 of the Act on Transport Services (320/2017). The legal basis for processing
is therefore Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR, i.e. compliance with the controller's
legal obligation.

### 5\. Disclosure of data and data recipients

Your personal data will only be disclosed to the administrator of the
Digitraffic service, who will act on behalf of Fintraffic and under the
obligation of professional secrecy, and who may use your data only for
monitoring the Digitraffic service and for investigating disruptions.

Fintraffic uses instructions and written data processing agreements to ensure
that the recipient complies with the regulations related to the processing of
personal data.

### 6\. Transfer of personal data outside EU or EEA countries

Your personal data will not be transferred outside the EU or EEA.

### 7\. Data storage

Fixed images transmitted through the Fintraffic Road Ltd camera system are
stored for 24 hours.

The retention period for log data depends on where these are stored. The log
data is thus stored for at least seven (7) hours and in certain situations for
the time being.

When the legal basis for processing no longer exists or your personal data is no
longer needed for the original purpose, your data will be destroyed
appropriately.

### 8\. Protection of personal data

Fintraffic has use of appropriate technical and organisational personal data
protection measures. Fintraffic thus ensures that your personal data is not
accidentally or unlawfully destroyed, lost or changed. The measures ensure that
the information is not disclosed without authorisation and cannot be accessed by
anyone who does not have the right to process the information: Fintraffic
ensures that the service provider complies with data protection legislation and
protects personal data with the necessary information security measures.

Only persons whose tasks include maintaining the Digitraffic service and the
provision of information are granted access rights to the system.
