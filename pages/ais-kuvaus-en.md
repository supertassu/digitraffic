The automatic identification system (AIS) is an automatic tracking system on
ships and vessels. It provides information such as unique identification,
position, course, and speed. AIS is intended to allow ships to view marine
traffic in their area and to be seen by that traffic.

Digitraffic service provides A class position and metadata messages. Some
AIS-messages are filtered or modified.

## Fishing vessels
